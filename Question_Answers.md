1.	__What paradigm?__
    Imperative – block structure

2.	__Who is intended audience, are they reached?__
    Meme, joke audience, yes they are reached

3.	__Environment? Is editor provided? What is compiler? What is exception handler like?__
    No specific editor exists, however VS Code has a syntax highlighter and linter for LOLCode.  
	There are two popular implimentations of LOLCode.  One is a command-line interpreter on unix systems, which much be compiled from source.  There also are several web interpreters.  Unsure about exception handling yet.  It doesn't seem like there are try/catch equivalents.  

4.	__What is documentation like?__
Github, Wikipedia, small websites that just regurgitate Github markdown documents.

5.	__How easy is it to debug the program, does is give adequate error messages?__
	lolcat provides decent error messages, while they are not terribly specific about what is needed syntactically, the error messages are informative of what it was expecting.

6.	__Evaluation of key language principles:__

    a.	__Readability__
    The way the language is read is the majority of the joke. It is failit easy to – assuming that you can understand cant meme lingo – read from an outside perspective. The all caps makes the screen look crowded, but adds to the humor of it all.

    b.	__Writiability__
    Initially, It’s quite difficult to write source code – most structures do not retain their common name, i.e. IM UPPIN YER i is i++; It is easy to write the basic few lines since they follow an English base logic, with HAI and KTHXBYE, but anything more complicated becomes a nightmare of referencing the docs.

    c.	__Security__
    TO_DO: Josh
    I need to play around with it more.  

    d.	__Expressiveness/Simplicity__
    A fairly simple language without a bunch of add-ons or extra functions.

    e.	__Efficiency__
    A scripted style language, so it’s as efficient as Python. -> check this please.


7.	__What data types are built in, are user defined types or dynamic variables allowed?__
No dynamic variables. Unsure of rest.

8.	__Did you like working with software?__
Amanda: Yes, it was humorous and rather fun to break the normal rules of coding.
Mitchell: Yes, My favorite part of learning this language and seeing it in action was to see how it was possible to stay true to the language and have it best kept uncompiled. 
9.	__Suggested use__

    Amanda: Just don’t use it. People have been applying LOLCODE to things like HTML rule parsers and such, so it’s obvious that the language is flexible
    Mitchell: The best use for this language is to kill time learning it, expanding your knowledge of how programming languages work, and have a good laugh.
    Josh: I believe the language will eventually replace COBOL.  It definitely mimics modern communication, otherwise known as Newspeak.  In all seriousness, my company is migrating off of Ruby to LOLCode for our backend.  
10.	__Research written? What does it say, agree/disagree?__
	Research has been done by many curious programmers looking for a good laugh and entertaining themselves with the language. I can agree with most of what Will Styler writes about in this article: http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/in_ur_programmz.html One of the languages best traits, as Will salutes, would have to be its linguistics.

11.	__What does language do good/bad?__

12.	__Hardware requirements__
Linux environment is easiest, WSL is workable, but difficult.
Note: I have windows 7 on a dusty hard drive somewhere.  I'll play around with compiling it for older versions of windows.  Aparently a lot of internal shit has changed between 7 and 10.  
13.	__Cost?__
Nothing! Well, you have to have a computer.
